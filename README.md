This Minecraft plugin is a simple survival game where lava gradually rises over time.

## Features

- **Rising Block:** The lava slowly rises from the bottom of the world of y-level -64 (Configurable).
- **Bossbar Countdown:** Creates a Bossbar that countdowns for the grace period and how long it takes for the lava to rise.
- **Save File:** If the server stops or the plugin gets disabled, the match will be saved and can be loaded using ``/fl load``.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjust the speed, block, and amount at which the lava rises to suit your difficulty.
